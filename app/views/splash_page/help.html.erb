      <h3 class="text-center" style="color:red;">HOW DO I USE TEXTITOR?</h3>
      <p>
        Textitor functions just like any other rich word processor except that it is completely online! It contains your standard rich text functions
        such as bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, and others. It also allows for numbered and bullet point lists as well as text alignment.
        This application also allows for changing font sizes as well as font types from a list of standard font sizes and font styles.
        Textitor recognizes standard hotkeys that many users know such as CTRL + B for bold, CTRL + I for italics, CTRL + U for underline, and CTRL + S for strikethrough.
        Tab is also recognized as an Indent as well as a button being created for this feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Textitor allows for saving and loading documents to and from your personal machine as well as to an account linked database. In order to use these features the user
        simply must name their document at the top left of the page and then click save plain to save their work to their local machine as a plain text file, .txt (which will not keep formatting if the user has done any)
        or save rich to save their work to their local machine as a rich text file .rtx (This will keep rich formatting but note it will not work with apps such as Microsoft word unless the file is converted to XML!)
        The user can also save their file to their profile which they can edit later by simply logging on again.
        </p>
